Sessions allow you to log in without having to enter a password or any other credentials. This is done by using a <br>
session cookie, a client-stored private key, or a client fingerprint.<br>
<br>
In every case, you have the option to remain anonymous or to use a name of your choosing. Your private information, <br>
such as your phone number, email address, and name, is not required unless you choose to reveal it of your own volition.<br>
<br>
We hope you find this place welcoming and safe.
