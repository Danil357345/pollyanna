People <br>
<br>
You're looking at the People page. There is also the Authors page, which contains all active participants, even <br>
ones not verified as a person. <br>
<br>
This page lists all of the people who have been verified through our cryptographic web of trust. This means that <br>
their identities have been confirmed by other members of our community. <br>
<br>
The main difference between people and authors is that people have been verified. This is important because it <br>
means that you can be more confident that you are interacting with a real participant.<br>
