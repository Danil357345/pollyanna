Hi, my name is Ilya, and I was inspired to develop this website on the morning of Friday, January 5, 2024.
As SEEK'24 drew to a close, I felt a surge of gratitude for the incredible experiences and connections we shared.
I couldn't let those memories fade away, and I wanted to create a space where everyone could relive those
special moments and keep the spirit of 'Be the Light' burning bright. So, with a heart full of SEEK'24 memories
and a believer's passion, I built this website. It's a humble offering, but I hope it becomes a beacon of
inspiration and community for all of us. Welcome, and let's share the light together!
