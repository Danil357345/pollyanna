	Hi, my name is Ilya, and I was inspired to develop this website on the morning of Friday, January 5, 2024.
	As SEEK'24 drew to a close, I felt a surge of gratitude for the incredible experiences and connections we shared.
	I couldn't let those memories fade away, and I wanted to create a space where everyone could relive those
	special moments and keep the spirit of 'Be the Light' burning bright. So, with a heart full of SEEK'24 memories
	and a believer's passion, I built this website. It's a humble offering, but I hope it becomes a beacon of
	inspiration and community for all of us. Welcome, and let's share the light together!

	Special thanks to Google Bard, ChatGPT, Claude, and CoPilot, without whom this website couldn't have come
	together as quickly as it has.

	Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?
	I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.

	Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has passed away; behold, the new is here!
