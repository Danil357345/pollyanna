concept Deleted_Page
  purpose display file hashes associated with items marked as deleted or archived, along with links to their children.

  state
    deleted_archived_entities: set FileHashWithChildren
      file_hash: String  // Represents the unique identifier for the file hash
      children_file_hashes: String (comma-separated List)  // Represents file hashes of the item's children

  actions
    None explicitly specified for the Deleted/Archived Page.

  operational principle
    Retrieve and display file hashes associated with items marked as deleted or archived.
    Include a column that lists the file hashes of the item's children.

  where
    Include file hashes where the attribute is 'chain_timestamp,' and the corresponding file hash is not present in the "item" table.

  Additional Considerations:
  - The Deleted/Archived Page aims to showcase file hashes associated with items marked as deleted or archived.
  - The state includes the unique identifier for the file hash and a column listing the file hashes of the item's children.
  - Results are determined based on the presence of the attribute 'chain_timestamp' and the absence of the corresponding file hash in the "item" table.
