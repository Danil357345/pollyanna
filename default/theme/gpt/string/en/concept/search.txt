concept Collaborative_Search

purpose facilitate searching by allowing users to submit public search queries and get notified of updates.

state
  search_queue: set SearchQuery
    query_id: String  // Unique identifier for the search query
    user: Person  // User who submitted the search query
    query_text: String  // Text of the search query
    results: set SearchResult  // Set of results contributed by other users
    user_notifications: set Person  // Set of users notified about updates

actions
  submitSearchQuery(user: Person, query_text: String)
    pre true
    // Additional logic to handle the submission of a search query to the public queue

  contributeSearchResults(query_id: String, user: Person, results: set SearchResult)
    pre query_id in search_queue
    // Additional logic to handle the contribution of search results to a query

  notifyUserOfUpdates(query_id: String, user: Person)
    pre query_id in search_queue
    // Additional logic to handle notifying the user about updates to their search query

operational principle
  Facilitate collaborative searching:
  1. Users can submit public search queries to the search queue.
  2. Other users can contribute search results to queries in the queue.
  3. Users who submitted a search query are notified when new information is added.

where
  Search queries are identified by a unique query_id.
  Results are associated with a specific search query.

Additional Considerations:
- The Collaborative Search feature enhances searching by involving multiple users in building search results.
- State attributes include unique query identifiers, users, query text, results, and user notifications.
- Actions include submitting search queries, contributing search results, and notifying users of updates.
