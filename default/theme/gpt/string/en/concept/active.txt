  operational principle
    Retrieve and display a list of authors or people who have been active on the resource recently.
    Active entities may include both Authors and People.
    The list is sorted based on the timestamp of their last activity in descending order.

  Additional Considerations:
  - The Active Page aims to show a dynamic list of active entities on the resource.
  - Active entities can be either Authors or People.
  - The state includes key details such as the entity's key, type, item score, and last activity timestamp.
  - Results are ordered based on the timestamp of the last activity in descending order.
