concept People_Page

purpose display a list of verified participants in the community, indicating individuals with confirmed identities through a cryptographic web of trust.

state
  people_entities: set Person
    author_alias: String  // Represents the alias or name of the verified participant
    author_key_count: Integer  // Count of unique author keys associated with the participant
    author_seen: Timestamp  // Timestamp of the last activity seen from the participant
    author_score: Integer  // Combined item score of the participant
    item_count: Integer  // Total count of items associated with the participant

actions
  None explicitly specified for the People Page.

operational principle
  Retrieve and display a list of verified participants in the community.
  Participants are identified based on their presence in the "person_author" table, indicating that their identities have been confirmed through a cryptographic web of trust.

where
  Include participants with a non-empty author_alias, at least one associated author key, and a non-negative author score.

Additional Considerations:
- The People Page lists individuals who have been verified through a cryptographic web of trust, providing a higher level of confidence in their identities.
- The state includes key details such as the participant's alias, the count of associated author keys, last seen timestamp, author score, and item count.
- Criteria for inclusion involve a non-empty author_alias, at least one associated author key, and a non-negative author score.
