concept Raw_Page
  purpose display a detailed output of recent server activity for the operator.

  state
    item_result: Resultset of items
      file_hash: String
      item_title: String
      labels_list: String (comma-separated List)
      item_score: Integer
      author_key: String
      author_score: Integer
      parent_count: Integer
      child_count: Integer
      add_timestamp: Timestamp
      item_sequence: Integer

  operational principle
    Retrieve data from the "item_flat" table with details on recent server activity.
    Join the "author_score" table to fetch additional author-related information.
    Order the results by the timestamp of item addition in descending order.

  Additional Considerations:
  - The Raw Page is designed to present detailed information about recent server activity.
  - Attributes include information about the item, author, and related metrics.
  - The SQL query performs a LEFT JOIN with the "author_score" table to enrich the data.
  - Results are ordered based on the timestamp of item addition in descending order.
