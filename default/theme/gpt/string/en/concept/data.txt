concept Data_Page

purpose enable users with freedom of data portability by providing access to message board data

state
  data_files: set DataFile
    file_name: String  // Name of the data file
    file_size: String  // Size of the data file

actions
  cloneToNewLocation(destination: String)
    // Additional logic to facilitate cloning the message board data to the specified destination

operational principle
  Provide access to message board data in multiple formats:
  1. Individual text files (/txt.zip) containing all items.
  2. SQLite database index (/index.sqlite3) and its compressed version (/index.sqlite3.zip).
  3. Source tree zip file (/tree.zip) containing the entire source tree.
  4. Allow users to clone data to a new location of their choosing.

Additional Considerations:
- The Data Page emphasizes freedom of location, date independence, and portability.
- State attributes include data files with their names and sizes.
- The operational principle involves providing access to data in various formats and supporting cloning functionality.

Media and Visual Elements:
- Include clear instructions and user-friendly visuals for cloning to a new location.
- Optionally, provide download links with icons for each data file format to enhance user experience.
