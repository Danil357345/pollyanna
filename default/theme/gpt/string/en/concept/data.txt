  3. Source tree zip file (/tree.zip) containing the entire source tree.
  4. Allow users to clone data to a new location of their choosing.

Additional Considerations:
- The Data Page emphasizes freedom of location, date independence, and portability.
- State attributes include data files with their names and sizes.
- The operational principle involves providing access to data in various formats and supporting cloning functionality.
