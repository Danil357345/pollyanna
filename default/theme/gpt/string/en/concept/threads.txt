  2. Filter discussions with positive scores and without specific labels.
  3. Provide a view of discussions ordered by the timestamp of their creation in descending order.

- State attributes include discussion details such as title, child count, score, file_hash, and creation timestamp.
- The operational principle involves querying and ordering discussions based on specified criteria.
