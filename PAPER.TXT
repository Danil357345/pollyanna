the finished configured product aims to help goal-oriented users with a task to accomplish

	the second type of task is more technical, and involves validating of information integrity
		for this purpose, site data is provided in transparent and convenient formats easy to validate and verify
			simple scripts to aid in validation are also provided (or should be)
	the third type of task is operation, such as transparently and effectively moderating the site
		a very common set of operation task is upgrades and configuration
