config/setting/admin/index/rewrite_menu_after_index

this makes the indexer go through all the existing templates under html/ and replace the menubar with an updated version.

it is good for keeping the number counts like "Threads(123)" consistent in the menubar.

it is not good to leave on while running `hike index` because it will slow it down.
