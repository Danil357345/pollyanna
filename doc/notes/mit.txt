	when offline
#academic partners
#	main page
#	item pages

#new sponsors
#	graphics

#sponsor bios
#ensure sponsor, partner pages all have the same design
#top banner should have logo title
#statusbar for partner pages should go to their site
#committee should be in correct order




index images under image/speaker ahead of others
	assign #speaker tag to these images
		change speakers page to query by this tag
do the same thing for sponsors:
	image/sponsor
		assign #sponsor tag
			set #sponsor page to query by this tag
