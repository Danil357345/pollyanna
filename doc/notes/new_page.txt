Creating a new page

default/template/html/page/example.template (or default/theme/yourname/template/html/page/example.template
	you can skip this if you're making a listing page
	otherwise, this is the content of the "main" dialog of the page.

default/template/perl/page/example.pl (or default/theme/yourname/template/perl/page/example.pl
- needs to have GetExamplePage()
	need to create a query template if using GetQueryAsDialog()
- error reporting could be better right now. to rebuild this file, you need to:
	a) run `hike refresh` to propagate the change from default to config
	b) run `hike make example` to rebuild the html page (this is where you would see your error)

makepage.pl: add to valid pages (search for @validPages or @simplePages)

TEST 1:
	when you fist go to http://localhost:2784/example.html, it will show a page missing
	but after you run `hike page example`, the page should work

route.php: look for validRoutes and add "example" to the list

handle_not_found.php: add to $validMakePageNames
