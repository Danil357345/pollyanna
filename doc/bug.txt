a Chrome device had a weird issue where I logged out,
	but when I clicked the Member button, I was logged back into the same account... very strange.
	I think there should be an additional "logged out" flag stored that takes precedence over any accidentally stored session and does extra to ensure the session information is wiped.

browser displays "operation is insecure" error message in debug console
setting:
	abrowser (close firefox derivative) 113.0.1
	set to highest security mode in privacy settings
todo: add traps for this error message
workaround:
	continue using site without javascript features
	to suppress error message, turn off javascript
		hike set js/enable 0 # this will turn off javascript rendering on the entire site, for all users
		turn off javascript support in browser
			about:config, javascript.enabled
	switch out of firefox secure mode

===

it would be very nice if going from changed setting to updated frontend was all automatic
	there is no watch process on config right now
		there's some sketch code for hashing the entire file tree

 i wrote the menu items capitalized and it broke the menu
	for now, we can all-lowercase the menu name before evaluating?
		we can also generate the html as the user asks
			but that's later

when hike frontend removes essential perl files, build should run, but does not

===

PubKeyPing() is not compatible with relativized urls at the moment

===

hike set image should shortcut to image/enable
	actually finds directory, which is totally wrong

===

hike.sh / tcsh / hike command doesn't work right

===

when searching for item's hash in project dir, original file is not found
	because uploaded image name is not changed
		workaround: look up filename in sqlite index

===

access_log_read.pl does not pick up boxes: parameter

===

rss feed is not generated by default

===

when pre-hiding is enabled, 404 page doesn't have content except tooltip

===

why isn't it displaying server messages when redirected with php??
	#lighttpd

===

access log timestamp not recorded properly (recording time is recorded instead)

===

Priorities
===============================
page rebuilding by php
allows building and updating without pre-building all the html
fast page updates with perl (fix targeting in index.pl and update.pl)
 long comments no longer sent via post!

===

two message= after submitting post

===

list of tags has issues in light mode

===

loading indicator doesn't go away on pages without openpgp.js

===

title mismatch between untitled item ('untitled') and page title (hash)

===

relative redirects don't work on some browsers
	like mosaic, see above

===

IE11: window.Promise returns false, which causes openpgp to not load
	openpgp does support ie11, and it used to work
	Need to figure out which features the Promise polyfill depends on, and create a test for them

===

theme/color/username remains at old setting in cache after config value change

===

Netscape 4.80 user-set font size is overridden by site #issue  #accessibility
	Probably need to get rid of fixed font sizes

===

"reply anonymously" is not true if cookie set

===

Fix relativize_urls on 404 page 
	1. go to /ab/cd
	2. click any link on 404 page
	current solution provides a fix which doesn't work if site is hosted in a subdirectory
	the actual solution is
		with javascript, the urls can be fixed post-loading
		without javascript, they can be fixed with ssi or php
		with full static only mode, ????

===

when replying, duplicate replies are posted
	cause: perl and php will generate different messages
		cause: php doesn't strip >> or replyto token
			solution: ensure php strips it too

===

with PHP enabled, replies create a dupe
	Dupe contains >> token at the bottom (from access log)
	Other copy does not (from PHP)
		#cause is cookie: and host: footers
		[in progress]

===

going back to a page with [x] advanced does not update checkbox status after it is has been changed down-history

===

figure out wtf is going on with GitPipe and why there are so many "fatal:"s

===

#todo  404 page links do not work with relative rewrite
#dupe

===

Opera 12.x : advanced controls cannot be shown

===

for sub-replies, >> token to be stripped is not set correctly

 When 0 text files, there is no Profile link

===

Reset settings (with js) does not change checkbox values to their defaults

===

on iOS, the ticking clock causes the "paste" command to be inaccessible
	When a textarea is held down, the Paste command appears briefly, but disappears as soon as the page needs to refresh
		make clock off by default?
		add clock in settings?

===

{require profile mode} is janky and locks out links and any non-cookie users
	how to make it not require cookies?
		probably session id that is rewritten into all links?
			a) generate cookie id
			b) get cookie id from page parameter
			c) rewrite cookie id into all links on page

===

write page reloaded and lost my content
	workaround:
	config/setting/admin/dev/fresh_reload=0
	(this is not a default setting)
	todo:
		write page should be excluded from this, perhaps?

===

dialogs should reflow when remember position is off and remember collapsed state is on

===

archive notice is not automatically indexed after archive

author id sort is incorrect on authors and scores pages
