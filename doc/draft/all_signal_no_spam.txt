How Pollyanna attempts to "solve" the spam problem.

A multi-layer approach is used:

Most accounts are vouched by a web of trust system.
This vouching process only happens once per device (ideally)
Or when the user clears browser storage.

New users coming into the system are reviewed by moderators
who take it upon themselves to review incoming information.

The choices made by these sentinenls are fully transparent,
and any non-unanimous agreement can be detected immediately
by any interested reviewing party.

Reviewers are self-selected and perform this duty for those
who do not have the capacity: the guests.

Guests are welcome with their existing hardware and clients,
and compatibility and accessibility are continously improved.
