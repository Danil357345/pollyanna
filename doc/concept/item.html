Item</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a base data type for most
other things in the system.</p>
<p><strong>State:</strong> An item is a piece of data that is
identified by its hash. It can store any type of data, such as text,
images, or videos.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Create item: Creates a new item
	and assigns it a hash. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Index item: Adds item’s
	properties to the index database and web pages.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Remove item: Removes the item’s
	data and properites, but retains notarization reference.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operational Principle:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Items are identified by their
	hash. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Items can store any type of data. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Items can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>A public key could be represented as an item. The item would store
the public key data and the hash of the public key would be used to
identify the item.</p>
<p>A user post could also be represented as an item. The item would
store the post data and the hash of the post would be used to
identify the item.</p>
<p>Labels could also be represented as items. The item would store
the label data and the hash of the label would be used to identify
the item.</p>
<p>The item concept is a powerful way to represent and manage
different types of data in a system. It is flexible and scalable, and
it can be used to implement a variety of features.</p>
<p>Here are some additional benefits of the item concept:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">It provides a common way to
	represent different types of data in a system. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">It makes it easy to add new types
	of data to the system without having to make major changes to the
	existing codebase. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p>Overall, the item concept is a valuable tool for designing and
developing software systems.</p>
