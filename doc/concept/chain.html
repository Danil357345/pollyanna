Chain</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide an auditable and validatable
log of all posted items, using hashes and timestamps to ensure
integrity and prevent tampering.</p>
<p><strong>State:</strong> A chain is a linked list of items, where
each item contains the following fields:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Hash of the item 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Timestamp 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Hash of the current line with the previous line (checksum) 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Add item to chain: Adds an item
	hash and timestamp to the chain. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Get item from chain: Retrieves an
	itemâ€™s timestamp from the chain by its hash. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Get all items from chain: Retrieves all items from the chain
	as sequence-hash-timestamp tuples. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operational Principle:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A chain is a linked list of items,
	where each item contains a hash of the previous item in the list, as
	well as a timestamp and a checksum of the current line with the
	previous line. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">To add an item to the chain, the
	hash of the previous item in the list is calculated and stored in
	the new item. The timestamp and checksum are also calculated and
	stored in the new item. The new item is then added to the end of the
	list. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">To retrieve an item from the
	chain, the hash of the item is used to find the item in the list. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>To retrieve all items from the chain, the list is traversed
	from beginning to end. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>A new item is posted to the system. The hash of the item, the
timestamp, and the checksum are calculated and stored in the item.
The item is then added to the end of the chain.</p>
<p>To verify the authenticity of an item, the hash of the item is
calculated and compared to the hash of the item in the chain. The
timestamp and checksum are also verified. If the hash, timestamp, and
checksum all match, then the item is authentic.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of the chain concept:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Chains provide an auditable and
	validatable log of all posted items. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Chains can be used to detect and
	prevent tampering with posted items. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Chains can be used to implement a variety of features, such
	as version control and content provenance. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
