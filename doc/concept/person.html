<body lang="en-US" link="#000080" vlink="#800000" dir="ltr"><p><strong>Concept:</strong>
Person</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To represent a single user or entity,
even if they have multiple public keys and/or multiple authorships.</p>
<p><strong>State:</strong> A person is a combination of one or more
authors, semantically linked through cross-labeling with the
&quot;approve&quot; label.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Get person: Retrieves the person
	associated with a public key or author. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Get all persons: Retrieves all persons in the system. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operational Principle:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A person is a combination of one
	or more authors, semantically linked through cross-labeling with the
	&quot;approve&quot; label. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>A person is uniquely identified by the hash of its
	corresponding item in the system. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>A user could create two public keys and use them to create two
different pieces of content. The two authors of the content would be
merged into a single person, since they are both associated with the
same user.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of the person concept:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The person concept provides a way
	to represent a single user or entity, even if they have multiple
	public keys and/or multiple authorships. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The person concept can be used to implement a variety of
	features, such as user profiles, social networking, and access
	control. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
