Label</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a way to attach labels to
items in a secure and verifiable manner.</p>
<p><strong>State:</strong> A label is an item that contains a
reference to one or more parent items, which are the subjects of the
label, and one or more labels. Labels are enclosed in a PGP enveloped
and signed to match the public key of the user who created the label.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Create label: Creates a new label
	and assigns it a hash. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Get label: Retrieves a label by
	its hash. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Update label: Updates an existing
	label. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Delete label: Deletes a label. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operational Principle:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Labels are identified by their
	hash. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Labels contain a reference to one
	or more parent items and one or more labels. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Labels are enclosed in a PGP enveloped and signed to match
	the public key of the user who created the label. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>A user could create a label for a public key to indicate that the
public key is owned by a trusted friend. The label would contain a
reference to the public key and a label indicating that the public
key is trusted.</p>
<p>A user could also create a label for a user post to indicate that
the post is about a particular topic. The label would contain a
reference to the user post and a label indicating the topic of the
post.</p>
<p>Labels can be used to categorize and organize items in a system.
They can also be used to provide additional information about items.
For example, a label could be used to indicate that an item is
sensitive or confidential.</p>
<p>The use of PGP enveloped and signed labels ensures that labels are
secure and verifiable. Only the user who created a label can update
or delete the label. Only users with the public key of the user who
created a label can verify the label.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of the label concept:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Labels provide a secure and
	verifiable way to attach labels to items. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Labels can be used to categorize
	and organize items in a system. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Labels can be used to provide
	additional information about items. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Labels can be used to implement a variety of features, such
	as access control, content moderation, and social networking. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
