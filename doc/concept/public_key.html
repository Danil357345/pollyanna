Public Key</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a secure way to encrypt
messages and verify digital signatures</p>
<p><strong>State:</strong> A public key is a cryptographic key that
can be shared with anyone. It is used to encrypt messages that can
only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Generate public key: Generates a
	new public key. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Share public key: Shares the
	public key with another user. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Encrypt message: Encrypts a
	message with a public key. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Decrypt message: Decrypts a message with a private key. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operational Principle:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Public keys can be safely shared
	with anyone. 
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Only the private key corresponding to a public key can be
	used to decrypt messages encrypted with that public key. 
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>A user could generate a public key and share it with anyone who
wants to send them encrypted messages. When someone wants to send the
user an encrypted message, they encrypt the message with the user's
public key. The user can then decrypt the message with their private
key.</p>
<p>Public keys can also be used to verify digital signatures. When a
user signs a digital document with their private key, they are
creating a digital signature that is unique to them. Anyone with the
user's public key can verify the digital signature to ensure that the
document was signed by the user and has not been tampered with.</p>
<p>Public keys are an essential part of many security technologies,
including secure messaging, digital signatures, and file encryption.
They are also used in many other applications, such as e-commerce and
social networking.</p>
